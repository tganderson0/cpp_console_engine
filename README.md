# Simple Game Engine

This is just a very simple game engine that is console based. I am using the rlutil library to draw on the console.

## Features

* Basic Collision detection and enforcement
* Tag objects to be affected by gravity
* You can move and jump
* Control the speed which time flows in the physics header file, as well as the gravity constant

I am pretty happy with what I have here, just a one day implementation of a simple console based game engine. The engine is pretty held back by the fact it has to run in a console, so work on this will probably end here as of now.
